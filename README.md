# nav0

**Browse. Nothing More.**

nav0 is a minimal, privacy-focused web browser built on Electron. No data collection. No bloat. No AI gimmicks. Just clean, safe browsing.

## Features

- **Lightweight** — Minimal resource usage for fast browsing
- **Privacy First** — Zero telemetry, zero tracking, zero data collection
- **No AI Bloat** — No forced assistants or "smart" features
- **Safe Browsing** — Built-in protection without surveillance
- **Open Source** — Fully transparent, audit it yourself

## Philosophy

Modern browsers have become bloated data harvesting machines. nav0 takes a different approach:

- **Do one thing well** — Browse the web, nothing more
- **Local over cloud** — Your data stays on your device
- **Absence over presence** — The best feature is often no feature
- **Transparent over proprietary** — Open source, open development

## What's Not Included

By design, nav0 does not include:

- User accounts or sign-in
- Sync services
- AI assistants
- News feeds
- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Telemetry or analytics
- Built-in VPN upsells
