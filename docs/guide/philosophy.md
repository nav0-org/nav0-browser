# Philosophy

nav0 exists because modern browsers have lost their way.

## The Problem

### Browsers Have Become Products

What was once a tool to view web pages has become:
- A data harvesting platform
- An advertising delivery system
- A feature showcase for engagement metrics
- A gateway to paid services

### Feature Creep

Every major browser now includes:
- AI assistants you didn't ask for
- News feeds curated by algorithms
- Shopping helpers tracking your purchases
- Cryptocurrency wallets
- Built-in VPNs (usually upsells)
- Password managers pushing subscriptions
- Reading lists, collections, workspaces...

Most users don't want these. They just want to browse the web.

### The Privacy Illusion

Browsers advertise "privacy features" while:
- Collecting telemetry by default
- Requiring accounts for basic features
- Syncing data to their clouds
- Partnering with advertisers

A truly private browser doesn't need privacy settings. It just doesn't collect data.

## Our Principles

### 1. Do One Thing Well

nav0 browses the web. That's it.

We don't try to be:
- Your AI assistant
- Your news source
- Your password manager
- Your cryptocurrency wallet
- Your shopping companion

Use dedicated tools for dedicated tasks. A browser should browse.

### 2. Absence Over Presence

The best feature is often no feature.

Every feature has costs:
- Code complexity
- Security surface
- Maintenance burden
- User confusion
- Potential for misuse

We add features only when absolutely necessary for core browsing.

### 3. Local Over Cloud

Your data belongs on your device:
- Bookmarks: local
- History: local
- Settings: local
- Everything: local

Cloud sync is convenient but comes with costs:
- Account requirements
- Data collection
- Server dependencies
- Privacy risks

### 4. Transparent Over Proprietary

Everything about nav0 is open:
- Source code: public
- Development: public
- Roadmap: public
- Decisions: public

If you can't see how it works, you can't trust it.

### 5. User Over User Data

We value users, not user data.

We succeed when:
- Users have a fast browser
- Users maintain their privacy
- Users trust their tools

We don't succeed by:
- Collecting user metrics
- Building user profiles
- Monetizing user attention

## What We Believe

### About Privacy

Privacy is not:
- A premium feature
- A toggle in settings
- Something to opt into
- A competitive advantage

Privacy is a right. nav0 treats it as such.

### About Simplicity

Simple doesn't mean:
- Lacking capability
- Ugly or unpolished
- Incomplete

Simple means:
- Focused
- Understandable
- Maintainable
- Trustworthy

### About Open Source

Open source is not:
- Just about free software
- A development methodology
- A business model

Open source is:
- Transparency
- Trust
- Community ownership
- Permanence (forks survive projects)

## The nav0 Way

### We Say No

To features that:
- Collect data
- Require accounts
- Add complexity without clear benefit
- Serve business interests over users
- Follow trends without purpose

### We Say Yes

To improvements that:
- Make browsing faster
- Increase security
- Reduce resource usage
- Fix actual bugs
- Serve user needs

### We Stay Focused

The web evolves. Browsers must adapt. But adapting doesn't mean:
- Adding every new feature
- Following every trend
- Copying competitors

It means supporting the web while staying true to our principles.
