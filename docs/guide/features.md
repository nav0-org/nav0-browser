## What's Intentionally Missing

We deliberately exclude:

| Feature | Why It's Missing |
|---------|------------------|
| AI Assistant | Unnecessary complexity, often cloud-dependent |
| News Feed | Distraction, usually ad-driven |
| Sync Service | Requires accounts, cloud storage |
| Rewards/Crypto | Not a browser's job |
| Built-in VPN | Usually upsells, trust issues |
| Reading List | Use bookmarks |
| Collections | Use bookmark folders |

## Customization

### Settings You Control

- Default search engine
- Start page
- Download location
- Cookie policy
- JavaScript enable/disable per site

### Settings We Don't Include
