## Why nav0?

The modern web browser has become bloated. What started as a simple tool to view web pages has transformed into a data harvesting machine packed with features most users never asked for.

**nav0 takes a different approach.**

We believe a browser should do one thing well: let you browse the web. That's it. No AI assistants trying to "help" you. No telemetry phoning home. No unnecessary features cluttering your interface.

```
nav0 = navigate + zero (bloat)
```

### The Problem with Modern Browsers

- **Data Collection**: Most browsers track your every move
- **Resource Hungry**: Gigabytes of RAM for a few tabs
- **Feature Creep**: AI assistants, news feeds, crypto wallets
- **Forced Accounts**: Sign in to sync, sign in to use

### The nav0 Solution

- **Zero Telemetry**: We collect nothing
- **Minimal Footprint**: Light on resources
- **Essential Features Only**: Browse, bookmark, done
- **No Account Required**: Use it anonymously
