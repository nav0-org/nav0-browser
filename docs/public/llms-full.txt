## Privacy Policy

Privacy is not a feature in nav0—it is the foundation.

### The Complete Policy

nav0 does not collect, store, transmit, or process any user data. Period.

### What nav0 Does NOT Collect

Telemetry: No usage statistics, no crash reports, no feature usage tracking, no A/B testing data.
Personal Information: No names, no emails, no accounts, no identifiers.
Browsing Data: No URLs visited, no search queries, no browsing history, no bookmarks.
Device Information: No hardware specs, no OS details, no screen resolution, no installed software.
Network Data: No IP addresses, no location data, no connection information, no ISP details.

### How nav0 Achieves This

No Accounts: No sign-in means no profile to build.
No Cloud Services: Data stays on your device—bookmarks, history, settings, downloads are all stored locally.
No Phone Home: nav0 makes no unsolicited network requests. No analytics pings, no heartbeat checks, no "anonymous" usage data, no background sync.
Open Source: Full source code available for auditing. Hidden tracking is impossible when anyone can read the code.

### Data Requests

If law enforcement requests user data: nav0 has nothing to provide. nav0 does not have user data. nav0 cannot give what it does not have.

## Philosophy

nav0 exists because modern browsers have lost their way. What was once a tool to view web pages has become a data harvesting platform, an advertising delivery system, and a feature showcase for engagement metrics.

### Core Principles

1. Do One Thing Well: nav0 browses the web. It does not try to be an AI assistant, a news source, a password manager, a cryptocurrency wallet, or a shopping companion.

2. Absence Over Presence: The best feature is often no feature. Every feature has costs—code complexity, security surface, maintenance burden, user confusion, and potential for misuse.

3. Local Over Cloud: All data belongs on the user's device. Bookmarks, history, settings—everything is local.

4. Transparent Over Proprietary: Source code, development, roadmap, and decisions are all public. If you cannot see how it works, you cannot trust it.

5. User Over User Data: nav0 values users, not user data. Success means users have a fast browser and maintain their privacy—not collecting metrics or building profiles.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is nav0?
nav0 is a free, open-source, privacy-focused desktop web browser built on Electron and Chromium. The name comes from "navigate + zero (bloat)."

### What platforms does nav0 support?
Windows (x64), macOS (Intel x64 and Apple Silicon ARM64), and Linux (x64). On macOS, install via Homebrew: brew install --cask nav0-org/nav0/nav0-browser. On all platforms, you can build from source.

### Does nav0 collect any data?
No. Zero. nav0 collects no telemetry, no usage statistics, no crash reports, no browsing data, no personal information, and no device information.

### Does nav0 require an account?
No. nav0 works fully without any sign-up, sign-in, or registration.

### Is nav0 open source?
Yes. nav0 is fully open source under the MIT License. The source code is available at https://github.com/nav0-org/nav0-browser.

### What browser engine does nav0 use?
nav0 uses Chromium via Electron, giving it compatibility with the modern web.

### Does nav0 support browser extensions?
nav0 supports extensions. Users should review extension permissions and prefer open-source extensions.

### How does nav0 make money?
nav0 is a community project. It does not monetize users.

### Why doesn't nav0 have an AI assistant?
nav0 does not include AI because it is not what a browser is for. AI features typically require sending page content and queries to cloud servers, which contradicts nav0's privacy principles.

### Why doesn't nav0 have a built-in VPN?
Browser VPNs create conflicts of interest and give users a false sense of security. A browser that collects zero data is already more private than any browser-plus-VPN combination.

### How does nav0 improve without telemetry?
Through voluntary bug reports, GitHub issues, community feedback, and the developers' own usage.

### What if nav0 gets acquired?
The code is open source under the MIT License. Even if the project changes hands, the community can fork it. Users can always build from a trusted commit.

### How is nav0 different from Brave?
While Brave has meaningful privacy protections, its business model depends on an advertising network and it ships with a cryptocurrency wallet and affiliate link injection. nav0 has no advertising, no crypto features, and no business model that depends on user data.

### How is nav0 different from Firefox?
Firefox receives approximately 80-85% of its revenue from Google search engine deals, creating a financial dependency. Firefox has also been adding AI-powered features. nav0 has no search engine deals and no AI features.
