# nav0

> A minimal, privacy-focused web browser. No data collection. No bloat. No AI gimmicks. Just clean, safe browsing.

nav0 is a free, open-source desktop web browser built on Electron and Chromium. It is designed for users who want a fast, lightweight browser that respects their privacy. nav0 collects zero telemetry, requires no accounts, and stores all data locally on the user's device.

## Key Facts

- **Type**: Desktop web browser application
- **Platforms**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Engine**: Chromium (via Electron)
- **License**: MIT (fully open source)

## Core Principles

1. **Zero Data Collection**: nav0 does not collect, store, transmit, or process any user data. No telemetry, no analytics, no crash reports.
2. **Local-Only Storage**: Bookmarks, history, settings, and downloads stay on the user's device. No cloud sync. No account required.
3. **Minimal by Design**: Only essential browsing features. No AI assistants, no news feeds, no crypto wallets, no built-in VPNs, no shopping tools.
4. **Open Source Transparency**: Full source code is public and auditable. Users can build from source for maximum trust.
5. **Privacy as Default**: Privacy is not a toggle or a premium feature. It is the architecture. There are no privacy settings because there is nothing to configure—no data leaves the browser.
