                  <p class="m-0"><strong>minP AI Browser is designed with privacy at its core.</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit your browsing data. All information and AI processing remains locally on your device, ensuring your digital privacy.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>At minP AI Browser, we believe that your privacy is a fundamental right. Our browser is built on the principle that your data belongs to you and should remain under your control. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to privacy and explains how we've designed our browser to protect your information.</p>
              <p>Unlike many other browsers, minP AI Browser processes all data locally on your device. This includes our AI features, which run directly on your machine without sending your browsing data to external servers.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
              <p>minP AI Browser is designed to not collect or transmit the following information:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Browsing history:</strong> Your browsing history remains exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</li>
                  <li><strong>Search queries:</strong> Searches performed through the browser are processed locally and are not logged or tracked by us.</li>
                  <li><strong>Form data:</strong> Information you enter into forms, including login credentials and payment information, stays on your device.</li>
                  <li><strong>Download history:</strong> Records of files you've downloaded are stored locally only.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> While websites may set cookies in your browser, we do not access or collect information from these cookies.</li>
                  <li><strong>AI interactions:</strong> All AI features process your data locally, with no data being sent to external AI models or servers.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Local Data Processing</h2>
              <p>minP AI Browser utilizes on-device processing for all its features, including advanced AI capabilities. This means:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Local AI processing:</strong> Our AI features run directly on your device using locally stored models.</li>
                  <li><strong>No cloud dependencies:</strong> The browser functions fully without requiring cloud connections for its core features.</li>
                  <li><strong>Data stays on your device:</strong> Your browsing data, preferences, and AI interactions never leave your computer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This approach not only protects your privacy but also allows the browser to function more efficiently and even work offline.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Limited Data Collection for App Functionality</h2>
              <p>While we do not collect browsing data, there are limited instances where minP AI Browser may collect minimal information:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Anonymous crash reports may be sent with your explicit permission to help us improve browser stability. These reports contain no personal information or browsing data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Update checks:</strong> The browser periodically checks for updates, which only involves connecting to our servers to verify if a new version is available.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Both of these functions can be disabled in the browser settings if you prefer complete isolation.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Browser Extensions</h2>
              <p>minP AI Browser supports extensions, which may have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any extension before installation.</p>
              <p>Extensions in minP AI Browser run in an isolated environment with limited permissions. By default, extensions cannot access your browsing data unless you explicitly grant them permission to do so.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Security Measures</h2>
              <p>To ensure your data remains secure even while stored locally, minP AI Browser implements several security measures:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Encrypted local storage:</strong> All locally stored data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption.</li>
                  <li><strong>Automatic private browsing:</strong> Option to automatically clear local data when you close the browser.</li>
                  <li><strong>Permission controls:</strong> Granular control over what websites can access (camera, microphone, location, etc.).</li>
                  <li><strong>Built-in tracker blocking:</strong> Advanced protection against tracking scripts and cookies.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
