                  <p class="m-0"><strong>Nav0 Browser is designed with privacy at its core.</strong> We do not collect, store, or transmit your browsing data. All information remains locally on your device, ensuring your digital privacy.</p>
              </div>
              
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>At Nav0 Browser, we believe that your privacy is a fundamental right. Our browser is built on the principle that your data belongs to you and should remain under your control. This Privacy Policy outlines our approach to privacy and explains how we've designed our browser to protect your information.</p>
              <p>Unlike many other browsers, Nav0 Browser processes all data locally on your device. All processing runs directly on your machine without sending your browsing data to external servers.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Information We Don't Collect</h2>
              <p>Nav0 Browser is designed to not collect or transmit the following information:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Browsing history:</strong> Your browsing history remains exclusively on your device and is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties.</li>
                  <li><strong>Search queries:</strong> Searches performed through the browser are processed locally and are not logged or tracked by us.</li>
                  <li><strong>Form data:</strong> Information you enter into forms, including login credentials and payment information, stays on your device.</li>
                  <li><strong>Download history:</strong> Records of files you've downloaded are stored locally only.</li>
                  <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> While websites may set cookies in your browser, we do not access or collect information from these cookies.</li>
                  <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> All features process your data locally, with no data being sent to external servers.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Local Data Processing</h2>
              <p>Nav0 Browser utilizes on-device processing for all its features. This means:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Local processing:</strong> All features run directly on your device.</li>
                  <li><strong>No cloud dependencies:</strong> The browser functions fully without requiring cloud connections for its core features.</li>
                  <li><strong>Data stays on your device:</strong> Your browsing data and preferences never leave your computer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>This approach not only protects your privacy but also allows the browser to function more efficiently and even work offline.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Limited Data Collection for App Functionality</h2>
              <p>While we do not collect browsing data, there are limited instances where Nav0 Browser may collect minimal information:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Anonymous crash reports may be sent with your explicit permission to help us improve browser stability. These reports contain no personal information or browsing data.</li>
                  <li><strong>Update checks:</strong> The browser periodically checks for updates, which only involves connecting to our servers to verify if a new version is available.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Both of these functions can be disabled in the browser settings if you prefer complete isolation.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Browser Extensions</h2>
              <p>Nav0 Browser supports extensions, which may have their own privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policy of any extension before installation.</p>
              <p>Extensions in Nav0 Browser run in an isolated environment with limited permissions. By default, extensions cannot access your browsing data unless you explicitly grant them permission to do so.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Security Measures</h2>
              <p>To ensure your data remains secure even while stored locally, Nav0 Browser implements several security measures:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Encrypted local storage:</strong> All locally stored data is encrypted using industry-standard encryption.</li>
                  <li><strong>Automatic private browsing:</strong> Option to automatically clear local data when you close the browser.</li>
                  <li><strong>Permission controls:</strong> Granular control over what websites can access (camera, microphone, location, etc.).</li>
                  <li><strong>Built-in tracker blocking:</strong> Advanced protection against tracking scripts and cookies.</li>
              </ul>
          </div>
          
          <div class="policy-section">
              <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
              <p>Nav0 Browser is designed for general audiences and does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age. The local-first design applies to all users regardless of age, ensuring that no one's browsing data is collected or transmitted.</p>
