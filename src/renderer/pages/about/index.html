              <p>What started as a small project has grown into a full-featured browser used by thousands of people around the world. We're committed to building a product that respects your privacy, enhances your productivity, and makes browsing the web a joy.</p>
              <p>Our journey is just beginning, and we're excited to have you along for the ride.</p>
